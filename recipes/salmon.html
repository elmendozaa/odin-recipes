    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Salmon and rice is a simple yet satisfying dish that brings together tender, flaky salmon with fluffy, perfectly cooked rice for a comforting and nourishing meal. Whether baked, pan-seared, or grilled, the salmon adds rich flavor and heart-healthy omega-3s, while the rice serves as a versatile base that soaks up any seasonings or sauces you pair with it. From a quick weeknight dinner to a well-balanced meal prep option, this classic combination is endlessly customizable with herbs, vegetables, and marinades to suit your taste.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup brown rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 pound salmon fillet</li>
        <li>1/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan bring 2 1/2 cups water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
